## Goal of Week 2

This week, we:

+ Had a brief practice with inputting values, and using if/elif/else conditions to evaluate our input.
+ Played around some more with logical operators: `and`, `or` and getting to know the concept of boolean in programming.
+ Took a look a while loops and solved some fun problems using while.

## Materials

+ [Recording of the workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCgKuk4DsmM)

## Recommended Practice

+ The Pi problem. If you didn't figure it out during our workshop, just take your time and work that out. There was 2 mathematical ways to solve the problem. During the workshop, we worked on the second method so it might be fun to try out the first one.

+ Visit [CodingBat](codingbat.com) -> Python. There's a lot of problems you can practice with especially in the **Warmup-1**, **Warm-up 2**, **Logic-1**, **Logic-2**  that we covered in the last 2 workshops.
+ [Sum of numbers that are Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
+ [Print out the Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). That is, the next number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers.
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...
```

## How to be prepared for Week 3

It is very important to practice, otherwise the information you learn will feel overwhelming.

+ Practice practice practice!
+ Make sure you understand the basic mathematical operator + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (integer division), ** (exponentiation), and very importantly % (modulus)
+ Be sure to understand the difference between a string and number and whether a number is a float or a int.
+ Understand what if, elif, and else do, and be able to write statements with them in python. Also know how to use the Boolean (True/False) operators >=, ==, <=, <, >, and, or within if statements.
+ Understand  why we need to keep updating the counter for while loops.
