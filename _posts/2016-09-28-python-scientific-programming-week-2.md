## Goal of Week 2

This week we will:

+ Take a look at **pandas**, an open source, BSD-licensed library providing **high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis** tools
+ Load in Excel (.xls or .csv) files to use in Python
    - Managing headers
    - Read-in only certain columns
+ Do some data manipulation:
    - List the names of the columns
    - Renaming columns
    - Create a new column
    - Doing math operations between two columns
    - Filtering out data or a subset of data
+ Do some plotting using Matplotlib, a very nice 2D plotting library in Python
    - Plot a histogram
    - Plot scatter plots
    - Plot normal plots
    - Modify the x-axis's title, y-axis's title, figure's title
+ If we have time, we can go through a quick example to show how powerful pandas is when it renders tens of thousands of rows super quickly.

## Suggested Practice

Our best advice, and this is how most of the officers in our team learned this in the first place, is to start doing your homework using code on the side.

We also suggest you partner up with someone in the club to help each other out and clear up confusions, and come up with things you can do together.

But in the mean time, you can:

+ You have data now. Play around with it! Plot different things. Filter out different stuff. And search your way through the process.
+ Play around with how cells work in Jupyter Notebook. Run each individually, or together and try to figure out the difference.
+ Play around with making functions! [Here's a pretty good tutorial/exercise](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions).
+ Play around with print and return and see for yourself what works and what doesn't work.
+ [Spoil yourself and look at some interesting notebooks people have made](http://nb.bianp.net/sort/views/).
