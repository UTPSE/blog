## [Python Notebook](goo.gl/3ccN5j)

## Suggested Practice

Our best advice, and this is how most of the officers in our team learned this in the first place, is to start doing your homework using code on the side.

We also suggest you partner up with someone in the club to help each other out and clear up confusions, and come up with things you can do together.

But in the mean time, you can:

+ You have data now. Play around with it! Plot different things. Filter out different stuff. And search your way through the process.
+ Play around with how cells work in Jupyter Notebook. Run each individually, or together and try to figure out the difference.
+ Play around with making functions! [Here's a pretty good tutorial/exercise](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions).
+ Play around with print and return and see for yourself what works and what doesn't work.
+ [Spoil yourself and look at some interesting notebooks people have made](http://nb.bianp.net/sort/views/).
