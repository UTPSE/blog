For those interested in attending the Java workshop on Mondays please follow
these instructions to set up your Java environment.

## Downloading and Installing Java

We will be using Java 8 (JDK 1.8) this semester. Navigate to the Java
[website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
and click on the link "Java SE 8u121" (8u121 is the latest verision at the time
of writing). You will be shown a list of operating systems, accept the license
agreement, and download the appropriate one for your computer from the first
set of options. For Windows you will end up with *jdk-8u121-windows-x64.exe* or
*jdk-8u121-windows-i586.exe* and Mac *jdk-8u121-macosx-x64.dmg*.

Once the download has finished just double click the file and follow the
prompts. You can check if Java is installed by looking for it in your programs,
namely "All Programs" in Windows 7 and in the start menu of Windows 10 by
searching for Java.

## Downloading and Installing Eclipse
To edit and run our Java programs we will be using Eclipse. If your prefer a
different IDE please use it, but we might be unable to help you as the course 
will be using Eclipse.

Download Eclipse Neon (at time of writing) from
[here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
The link you want is the orange button underneath "Install your favorite Eclipse
packages."

Once the download has finished double click the file and you will be greeted by
a list of different IDEs you can install. We want the very first one "Eclipse
IDE for Java Developers". Click on it and then on install. Once it finishes you
can see if it works by clicking the green Launch button.

Once Eclipse is open you will be greeted by a workspace prompt. This is where
Eclipse will store all you code files and projects. The default is perfectly
fine but you can change this to be a folder on your Desktop if you prefer. Make
sure to check the "Use this as the default and do not ask again" box so you
don't have to worry about it every time. 

You are now ready to take our Java workshop, however, if you want to play around
with Java right now you can take the Hello World tutorial. On the Welcome screen
which appears when you open Eclipse there is an option titled "Create a Hello
World application". This tutorial will teach you some basics of Eclipse and Java
to let you print the famous "Hello World" to the console.
