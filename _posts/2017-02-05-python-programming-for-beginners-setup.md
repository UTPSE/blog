If you wish to attend the Python classes, please follow these simple instructions. If you have any problems, we will help at the beginning of class to get everything working.

## Downloading and Installing Python

To install python, simple google "install python" or go to this link: 
[website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and click "Download Python 3.6.0". Once done, you should have a text editor
called IDLE on your computer and you are ready to write code! Open IDLE, Make
a new file. In that file, type in some python code such as "print('Hello World')".
Either press the f5 key or select "Run Module". Inside the other Shell window, 
the ouput of your code should show up. Congratulations! Especially if that was
the first code you ever ran!
