## Goal of Week 1

This week, we:

+ Downloaded python and the basic code editor, IDLE.
+ If you haven’t already, go to this [link]( https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click ‘Download Python 3.5.2’.
+ Learned about variables and the basic data types in python.
+ Learned about the mathematical operators in python.
+ Learned about if statements and how to use them.

## How to be prepared for Week 2

It is very important to practice, otherwise the information you learn will feel overwhelming.

+ Go to the website [CodingBat] (http://codingbat.com/python) and practice. Warmup-1 and Logic-1 practice sets will help you. Don’t be afraid to get hints or look up the solutions if you can’t figure it out.
+ Make sure you understand the basic mathematical operator + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (integer division), ** (exponentiation), and very importantly % (modulus)
+ Be sure to understand the difference between a string and number and whether a number is a float or a int.
+ Understand what if, elif, and else do, and be able to write statements with them in python. Also know how to use the Boolean (True/False) operators >=, ==, <=, <, >, and, or within if statements.

Here are a few random practice problems that you can do. If you can solve them, you should be prepared!

+ Ask a user to input their age. If they are under 18, print that they can’t drink or join the military, if they are over 18, print that the can join the military, if they are over 21, print that they can drink.
+ Write out the variables for width and height, and then print the area of the resulting triangle.
+ Ask the user to input the current year. Print whether or not it is a leap year. Hint: use the modulus operator.


## Additional Material

+ [This YouTube Video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA) covers moth of Python in 45 minutes. But don’t be surprised if you don’t understand a lot of it.
+ [This YouTube Video]( ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTV6bILLP_s) cover python at a much more appropriate pace.
