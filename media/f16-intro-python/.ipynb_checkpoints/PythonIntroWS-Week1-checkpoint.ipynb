    "This week, we will:\n",
    "+ Spend a little bit of time getting farmiliarized with Python the language. What we think are the pros and cons with the language. \n",
    "+ Install Python. \n",
    "+ Learn some basic operators in Python.\n",
    "+ Learn about variables and the different types of data in Python (int, float, string, etc.). \n",
    "+ Learn about getting user's input using the input() function.\n",
    "+ Write our first if, else if, and else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note\n",
    "+ In this notebook, I will run the code cell-by-cell to show you the error and the result that Python gives out every time we run a snippet of code. However, you will most likely use a IDE (a.k.a Integrated Development Environment) like the default Python IDE, PyCharm, or something else, which is absolutely fine.\n",
